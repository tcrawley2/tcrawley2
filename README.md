## Who I am ðŸ‘‹ 
Hi, my name is Tim. I'm a professional athlete turned CS graduate student. Back in 2017, I was an NFL undrafted free agent, participating in the Rookie Mini-Camp for the Cleveland Browns. Although I had a great showing, I started a professional career in the business setting shortly after and never looked back! In 2021, I enrolled in Graduate School at Northeastern University and after 3 long years I've graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science. 

## What I am interested in ðŸ‘€ 
Iâ€™m interested in anything and everything CS and programming related. While completing my undergrad in Business MIS, I found that the classes I enjoyed the most involved technical skills in some capacity. This was also the case in the professional world. I think my interests ultimately pushed me toward pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science.

## What I'm currently learning ðŸŒ± 
Iâ€™m currently learning web frameworks like React and Django, but I've programmed in Python, Java, JavaScript, C and C++, along with HTML and CSS. Although it's not really a programming language, I have lots of experience in SQL, both in an academic and professional setting.
